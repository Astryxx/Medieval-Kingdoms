‚ö†Ô∏è Extremely Early Beta - Now Available!

Download: You can find the latest beta release file on the Releases page.

Project Overview

The Medieval Kingdoms Mod transforms the standard Minecraft experience by introducing a dynamic, persistent simulation of medieval society. Instead of simple villages, players will encounter sprawling, unique kingdoms with their own political, economic, and military systems.

The ultimate goal is to allow players to interact with, influence, and even rule a complex world governed by laws, reputation, currency, and conflict.

Key Planned Features

The mod is structured around five major development modules:

1. Kingdom Core & Generation (The Foundation)

Dynamic Overhaul: Vanilla villages are upgraded into unique, named kingdoms with customizable banners and distinct cultural themes (e.g., Nordic, Byzantine).

Core Structures: Implementation of essential structures like the Castle (Royal Keep), Town Hall, and military Barracks protected by perimeter walls.

Leadership: Introduction of Kings/Queens and a system of Nobility (Barons, Dukes) who are elected or gain power through land ownership.

2. Economic & Land System

Universal Currency: Implementation of a tiered currency system using Copper, Iron, and Gold Coins, with Emeralds as the main high-value currency.

Financial Mechanics: Players can utilize Bank Structures for storage, pay Land Tax and Trade Tax, and acquire official Deeds of Ownership for property.

3. Law, Morality, and Crime

Morality System: Kingdoms operate under a customizable legal system influenced by Lawful/Chaotic and Good/Evil alignments.

Reputation: Players earn a reputation (from Heroic to Criminal) that dynamically affects how villagers and guards interact with them.

Underground Systems: Introduction of crimes, consequences, and hidden structures like Thieves' Guild Hideouts and Black Markets in chaotic kingdoms.

4. Guilds & Social Life

Professions: Players can join various Guilds (Merchants', Blacksmiths', Mages') and take on specific Jobs (Miner, Mercenary, Scribe).

Social Hubs: Integration of interactive social structures like the Tavern & Inn (for rumors/news) and central Marketplaces.

5. Warfare, Military, & Special Features

Standing Armies: Kingdoms maintain armies of Knights, Guards, and Archers, controlled by the ruler.

Warfare: Implementation of mechanics for War Declarations against rival kingdoms and the use of Mercenary Contracts.

Future Expansion: Plans for Siege Warfare (Catapults, Ballistae) and Naval Systems in coastal areas.
